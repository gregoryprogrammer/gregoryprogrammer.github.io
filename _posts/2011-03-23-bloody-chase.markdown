Unstoppable running vampire.
Game made with Flash technology inspired by Canabalt.
You can play it [here][game] or watch the [video][video].


It was my first game written in the ActionScript3.
During work on this project I learned how to use the [Flixel][flixel] framework to create a simple platformer. 
Design is inspired by the [Canabalt][canabalt].
I used Gimp and Blender to make graphics.
Music was provided by [Kevin MacLeod][kevin].
The game is available to play on the [Freegame.cz][game] where you can challenge with other players.
