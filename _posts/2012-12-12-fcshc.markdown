Compile ActionScript with mxmlc is very slow, because each time the whole code is recompiled.
Flex SDK provide tool fcsh shell which can speed up this process by incremental compilation.
Unfortunately usage of that shell is inconvinient.
Mainly by need to type each time _compile 1_ command to recompile changed part of code (_arrow up_ to repeat last command doesn't work).
I wrote a script that helps in usage of that shell.
